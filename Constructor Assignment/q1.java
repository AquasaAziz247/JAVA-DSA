// A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
// It is called when an object of a class is created. The constructor has the
// same name as the class and does not have a return type (not even void). The
// primary purpose of a constructor is to set initial values for the objectâ€™s
// fields.

public class q1 {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
